## About it

This is an Open RPG - Sound Library for RPG players! This repo is for control reasons only. Feel free to contribute, fork this project and use it wherever you want.

The idea of this project is to create a tool to RPG masters to control the soundtrack of their adventures in an easy way. If you want to get it touch with me to get a working version of this software feel free to get in touch by email, but keep in mind that the software is still being developed!

Here is a picture of the working project:
